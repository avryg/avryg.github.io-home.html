<h1>My Favorites, AKA Most Worth Your Time</h1>
<h2> With some many amazing sights and hundreds of pictures collected between us all, I thought I'd just show you some of my personal favorites, ones that I hope you get just as much joy out of as I do.</h2>
<p> Here's a picture I took that most of you will recognize, these three rocks are known as Faraglioni and are found right off the shore of Capri..</p>

<p>Now here's a beautiful shot of the Roman Colosseum taken by a friend. By far one of the most fascinating landmarks to visit..</p>

<p>Next here you'll see just the outskirts of my favorite city: Sorrento. I wish I had taken more pictures while there but I was too intrigued.. </p>

<p>Finally, the amazing Vatican in its country of it's own: Vatican City. Although there's multiple NO PICTURE signs, everyone was taking pictures.</p>
